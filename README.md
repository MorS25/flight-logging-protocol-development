This protocol was approved for release to all GUTMA members during the Dec. 19 2017 board's meeting. It is currently out for member comments, with a final vote scheduled for the end of January. If approved by GUTMA members, the protocol will then be open to public comments.

### Goals ###

The protocol's purpose is to harmonize flight telemetry data logs (such as GPS location, speed, and if available: battery voltage, drone identifier, battery identifier, payloads identifier).
It is targeted at UAV manufacturers. Logs can then be used by UAV pilots, third-party drone management software providers, governments, and authorities interested in using these data with the operator's authorization.
