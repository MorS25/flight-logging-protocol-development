This protocol was approved for release to all GUTMA members by the board on Dec. 19 2017. It is currently out for comments, with a vote of full members scheduled at the end of January. The protocol will then be open to public comments.

### Goals ###

The protocol's purpose is to harmonize flight telemetry data logs (such as GPS location, speed, and if available: battery voltage, drone identifier, battery identifier, payloads identifier).
It is targeted at UAV manufacturers. Logs can then be used by UAV pilots, third-party drone management software providers, governments, and authorities interested in using these data with the operator's authorization.
