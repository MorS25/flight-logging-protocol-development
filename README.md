# README 

This is the development version of the GUTMA protocol. The aim of this repository is to develop and build on the on the published flight logging protocol. 

### Goals

The [published](https://github.com/gutma-org/flight-logging-protocol) protocol takes a longer time to update since it has to go through the review cycle. The goal of this repository is to advance the published protocol by doing more tests and providing a flexible way to address new and existing concerns as the UTM ecosystem develops. The best way to engage with this is to review the protocol document, the goals and differences and open issues in this repository.
